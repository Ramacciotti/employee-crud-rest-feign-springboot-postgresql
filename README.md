## Description

This project implements a CRUD system for employee management, using Spring Boot for the application, Feign Client for external API communication, and PostgreSQL as the database.

## Technologies

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Feign Client
- PostgreSQL
- Maven
- JaCoCo (for test coverage)
- Mockito & JUnit 5 (for unit testing)

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher installed
- Maven 3.6 or higher installed
- PostgreSQL database configured and running

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   cd employee-crud
   ```

2. Configure the database properties in

 ```src/main/resources/application.properties ou application.yml.   ```

3. Run the project using Maven:

  ```mvn clean install```
  ```mvn spring-boot:run```

## How to Test

To run unit tests and generate the coverage report:

 ```mvn clean verify```

## Important Configurations

1) The JaCoCo plugin is configured to exclude DTO, model, and exception classes from coverage since they are POJOs without logic to test.
2) To modify exclusions or JaCoCo settings, check the pom.xml file.
3) Set database credentials and URL in application.properties or application.yml.
